Welcome to the main window of the billing
system!

The first thing you should be able to see
is your name.

This main window contains a lot of buttons
so let's go through all of them to try and
clear things up!

Buttons:
 - <E P A L C O>
 - <Generate Bill>
 - <Pay>
 - <View Transaction History>
 - <Logout>
 - <Notification button> (bell icon)
 - <Help button> ("?" icon)

 1. <E P A L C O>

 -> This button is just the main page
 button which shows your name and then
 your electricity meter.
 The electricity meter should update every
 day at 12:00AM, the electricity meter uses
 kWh measurement to determine total
 electricity consumption for the entire
 billing period.

 2. <Generate Bill>

 ->In the 20th day of the month, meter readings
 are done automatically by the system. This
 records every user's current reading and 
 their previous reading, and then on the 21st
 day, the bill is then generated and you are
 going to have to pay it in the pay page by
 clicking the <Pay> button.

 The bill contains a lot of information such as:
 - the billing period dates (previous & current)
 - meter reading for (previous & current)
 - the total kWh usage
 - pay before
 - the rate
 - value added tax
 - total payment without value added tax
 - added value added tax
 - total payment last billing period
 - total payment this billing period
 - total pending balance

Most of the contents of the bill are self
explanatory but let's clear up some things.

The total payment is calculated like this
pay = (previous - current) * rate
addVat = ((previous - current) * rate) * VAT
FINAL = pay + addVat

You must pay "BEFORE" the date given by the
"PAY BEFORE".

If you are not able to pay this billing period,
don't worry! Your account won't be closed and
you absolutely won't get your electricity cut
off but they payment you had last billing
period will pile up the next billing period!
So make sure that your payment is ready! If
you still failed to pay the 2nd time, your
account will be given 2 days to pay the pending
balance or at least pay last month's bill to
avoid getting your account closed. If all else
fails, your account will be closed and your
electricity will eventually be cut off. If you
want to reopen your account, please pay the
entire pending balance!

3. <Pay>

-> As mentioned earlier, you have two options when
paying, you can either pay the entire pending
balance, or at least pay last month's unpaid
balance (If you did not paid last month). After
choosing which option, you will be redirected
to a window to pay the proper amount and then
after successfully paying, you will receive the
proper amouont of change.

4. <View transaction history>

-> Each payment you made will be recorded and saved
in the system's database and you are given the option
to be able to view each transaction you have made
throughout the existence of your account. This may
act as some sort of payment receipt.

5. <Logout>

-> This will return you to the login window.

6. <Notification button>

-> Everytime a bill is generated, you will receive
a notification that will let you know that a new bill
has been generated.

7. <Help button>

-> This is the button you used to read this message!
