This is the create acccount window
This is where you are going to create an account.
Fill each entries properly.

In the account number entry, you can add as much 
spaces as you like between numbers to improve 
readability. Regardless if whether or not you
placed spaces, the system will automatically remove
those spaces before inserting your account to the
database!

When an account has been successfully created, that
particular account is then inserted into the
billing system's database and you will now be
able to login to the account 
you just created!
